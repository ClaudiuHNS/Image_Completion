# Introduction

<div>
    <p align="justify">
    Image/Video editing tools and applications have been widely used in many areas, including marketing, fashion design, and film production. Among these applications, we are especially interested in Image Completion, and think it is an important function. Why is Image Completion important? Actually, it is very useful for lots of purposes. No matter it’s for everyday photo or movie post-processing, it can help you remove objects you don’t want (see Fig1 and Fig2).

# State-of-the-Art

    Although this work is very powerful, it may still fail in some cases (see Fig4). We also find other problems with this model. Usually, It takes lots of time and images to train a model. Also, it doesn’t provide an interactive way for users to improve results if they are not good enough.

# Adobe Photoshop: Content Aware Fill (PatchMatch)

<div>
    <p align="justify">
    Thus, we’re more interested in what’s the industry solution for this problem since we usually ask for a higher standard of image quality provided by those market products. We find that Adobe Photoshop also has this function which is called Content Aware Fill (see Fig5) using PatchMatch algorithm [2]. So, we try to find some insights from this algorithm.

# PatchMatch 
## Algorithm

<div>
    <p align="justify">
    The purpose of the PatchMatch algorithm is to efficiently find the similar patches between two images. Basically, its algorithm contains three steps: random initlization, propagation, and random search (see Fig6).
    </p>
</div>

<div align="center">

        <img src="report/image/image6.png" class="inline" width="620" height="426"/>
        <p><b>Figure 6:</b> <i>PatchMatch Algorithm</i></p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <p align="justify">
    Take Fig7 as example. For each patch in A, we try to find a similar patch in B. In the fist step, we randomly match each patch in A with a patch in B. If we’re lucky, we may get some pairs already similar enough. Then, in the second step, we check if our neighbors can give us a better candidate patch. If it is, we just propagate this benefit, i.e., just update the patch. In the final step, we continue looking for a better patch in our neighborhood by random search in order to get out of a local optimum.

    </div>
</div>

## Simulation Result

<div>
    <p align="justify">
    Here is the simulation results (see Fig8). You can see how fast this algorithm is. Even for the first iteration, we can almost reconstruct the image just using pixels from B. Then, after that, each iteration just gets the result sharper and sharper.

    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <p align="justify">
    In addition to the subjective evaluation, we also calculate its SNR score, which shows how similar two images look like. According to the SNR formula below, we calculate 27.860412 as the SNR score, which also shows that the original image and the final result are very similar based on the criteria of ISO 12232: Electronic Still Picture Cameras.

# Image Completion
## Task Definition
<div>
    <p align="justify">
        Image completion/inpainting is used when there is corrupted or unwanted region in image and we want to fill those region with
        pixels that are coherent with the background. Below is an illustration, say we want to remove the cow in the image, we will
        done that by remove the cow from image and try to complete it.
    </p>

        <p><b>Figure 10:</b> <i>Image Completion Task Definition</i></p>
    </div>
</div>

## First try
<div>
    <p align="justify">
        To use patchmatch for image completion, we come up with this straight forward method.
        First, find a bounding box of the missing region.
        Then for each patch in the bounding box, we try to find the nearest patch outside the bounding box use PatchMatch.
        Finally, we just use those nearest patches to vote for the pixel value inside the missing region.
    </p>
</div>

        <p><b>Figure 12:</b> <i>Result of First Try</i></p>
    </div>
</div>

## What's the problem?
<div>
    <p align="justify">
        We can observe that there are some blurred region of the result in Figure 12. It is because the nearby pixels in the
        missing region are not finding coherent nearest neighbor patches. When those patches voting for the pixel, they give
        different votes and averaging them yields blur region.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        So how can we find better nearest neighbor patches?
        Turns out that we want patch size to be large enough in the first hand to see the global picture of the image.
        Meanwhile, we also want it to become small enough in the end so that our algithm can be aware of local structure
        and produce sharp image. The answer to that is adaptive patch size, or we can done that by fix patch size and varying
        the image size in multiple scale.
    </p>
</div>

## Multi-Scale Image Completion
<div>
    <p align="justify">
        We use multi-scale image completion, as described in [3].
        We start from the smallest scale, do image completion at that scale, then keep scaling up until we meet the original scale.
        In each scale change, for the pixels outside the missing region, we simply scale down the original image to that scale;
        for the pixels inside the missing region, we scale up the filled region as initialization of next scale.
    </p>

## Incorporating Constraints
<div>
    <p align="justify">
        However, sometimes it still produce images with artifacts, like the left image of Figure 17.
        Luckily, there is a solution. We follow [1] to incorporate user-specified constraints to enhance the completion result.
        To do that, we simply restrict the constrained pixels in missing region to search for patches that are of same constraint.

# Interactive GUI
<div>
    <p align="justify">
    We designed an interactive GUI for end users. User can load an image and mask for that image. Then he/she can introduce some contraints to maintain some boundaries and let the algorithm complete the hole in the image. Using our imterative interface user can improve the performance of image completion. For a short demonstraion please watch the video below.
